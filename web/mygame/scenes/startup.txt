In an attempt to fight the Lord, many warriors and soldiers have lost their lives. It almost seems as if this destruction is inevitable. However, the Scrolls of Wisdom have pointed to one savior that will save us all. This individual shall defeat the Lord in the final battle. However, prior to doing so, they shall travel across the four nations to collect as much wisdom and skills to be strong enough to fight and defeat the Lord. These nations are the Water Village, Earth Nation, Fire Kingdom, and Wind Temple.

The Scrolls of Wisdom glow when pointed to the savior that is predetermined by fate. In desperate measures, the people have pointed the scrolls to each and every member that is able to engage in combat. After ongoing attempts of trying to identify the savior, the scrolls pointed to the one person who was destined by fate: Ivan, an orphan blacksmith. At first, it was a surprise, since Ivan is a scrawny individual who appears to be incapable of combat. However, as dictated by the scrolls, Ivan must now take on the journey of collecting wisdom and skills to conquer the Lord of the Underworld.
