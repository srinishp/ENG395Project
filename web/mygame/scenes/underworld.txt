As you search for them, a wild creature, a three-headed demon-wolf appears from the void with a taste for carnage. This is Cerberus, the guard hound of the Underworld. You must first defeat it to get to the Lord of the Underworld.

Remember the weapons that you were granted from the four nations after slaying their respective guardians? Now you may use them to defeat Cerberus. Furthermore, you may have to use multiple weapons. However, keep in mind that using a weapon on Cerberus will drain it of its complete energy, causing it to disappear after inflicting damage on Cerberus.
