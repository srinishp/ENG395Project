You hear the Lord of the Underworld, enraged, rushing towards you because you have defeated their guard dog. 

*page_break

As they rush towards you, I will give you some context on who the Lord of the Underworld is:

Pluto was one of the Lords who were appointed with responsibilities in regulating different aspects of the world. Pluto was assigned the task of maintaining the Underworld and was in charge of controlling the evil that has once took place in the world. However, as years passed, Pluto became consumed by the darkness that existed in the Underworld and instead of controlling it, it began to control them. As a result, they decided to conquer the world and spread their influence, filling they world with eternal void.

Now it is up to you to strategically defeat Pluto!

Pluto finally arrives and as the void consumed them, over the years, they began to develop a menacing and destructive appearance. It is almost as if it is impossible to defeat them. No wonder why so many soldiers and warriors have passed in an attempt to defeat them.

However, you must not back down. Pluto realizes that you do not have any weapons and decides to give you an offer: 
*choice
  #Surrender to them in return for your life and you shall be enslaved by them for the rest of your life
   *goto_scene victory surrender
  #Continue with your mission and challenge them to a duel without any weapons and with the risk of losing your life
   *goto battle
   *finish

*label battle
You have decided to challenge Pluto to a duel. However, since you have no weapons you must use the moves that you have learned from battling the guardians of the four nations. Keep in mind: You are not worthless without your weapons, and you are capable of anything as long as you have the skill and faith to help you. You must go through a specific combination of combat moves to successfully defeat Pluto.
